**Cross-Camera Player Re-Identification (YOLO + DeepSORT)**

This project enables cross-camera player re-identification using a fine-tuned YOLOv11 object detection model along with DeepSORT for player tracking. The notebook processes two synchronized videos (broadcast.mp4 and tacticam.mp4) to maintain consistent player IDs across both camera feeds â€” ideal for sports analytics.

**Google Drive Setup**

The pretrained YOLO model (best.pt) is stored in Google Drive. Make sure to mount your Google Drive in Colab and place the file accordingly.

ðŸ”— Download best.pt from this Drive link : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14miSAujyZvaucxGRMJnK3mDnXMy93moL?usp=sharing

After downloading, upload best.pt to your own Drive, then mount it in Colab and set the path:

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Example path
model_path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/best.pt"

**Files Included**

CrossCamera_Player_ReID.ipynb â€“ Main Colab notebook for tracking and re-identification

best.pt â€“ Fine-tuned YOLOv11 model weights

Input Videos â€“ broadcast.mp4 and tacticam.mp4 (you can upload via Colab or Drive)

**Install Dependencies**

Run the following in a Colab cell:

!pip install -q ultralytics filterpy opencv-python-headless matplotlib pandas

**Set correct paths to:**

best.pt

broadcast.mp4

tacticam.mp4

Run all cells in order.

Final output video with consistent player IDs will be saved to disk.

**Output**

Annotated video showing consistent player identities across cameras.

Visualization handled using OpenCV and pandas.

Notes:

The YOLOv11 model is custom-trained; re-training may be needed for other sports or teams.

Synchronization between video feeds is crucial for accurate matching.
